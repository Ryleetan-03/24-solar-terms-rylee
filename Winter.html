			<p>It is one of the most important seasonal points in Chinese folklore, where spring is plowed and summer is cultivated, autumn is harvested and winter is hidden, and winter is the season to enjoy the harvest and recuperation. In ancient times, it was also one of the "four seasons and eight festivals" and was a very important festival, with ancestor worship and feasting in some parts of China. Traditionally, winter starts at the beginning of the twenty-four solar terms "Lidong", which means that everything enters a state of rest and recuperation.

			<p>Xiaoxue, the 20th of the twenty-four solar terms, is the second solar term in winter, occurring on November 22 or 23 of each year, when the sun reaches 240° of the ecliptic. Xiaoxue is a festival that reflects precipitation and temperature, and it is a festival with a high frequency of cold wave and strong cold air activity. The arrival of the Little Snow Festival means that the weather will become colder and the amount of precipitation will gradually increase. Snow falls, the coming year rain evenly, no big drought and flood; two, snow can freeze some germs and pests, the coming year to reduce the occurrence of pests and diseases; three, snow has a warming effect, conducive to the decomposition of organic matter in the soil, enhance soil fertility

			<p>“Heavy “Snow is a termthat reflects the characteristics of the climate. It is characterized by a significant drop in temperature and an increase in precipitation compared to autumn and early winter. At the time of snow, most areas of China have entered the cold winter season, with the lowest temperatures in some northern regions falling to 0°C or below. Precipitation (rain or snow) increases in areas where cold and warm air meet in front of strong cold air. In meteorology, water vapour condensation such as rain, snow and hail that falls from the sky to the ground is called "precipitation". The meaning of the seasonal snow is different from that of the weather snow. In fact, the snow during Heavy Snowis often not as big as the Light Snow, and the largest amount of snow throughout the year is not in the Light Snow and Heavy Snow time.

			<p>Winter Solstice, also known as the Southern Solstice, the Winter Festival, and the Sub-years, has both natural and humanistic connotations, and is not only an important festival among the 24 solar terms, but also a traditional ancestral festival among Chinese folk. The winter solstice is one of the eight festivals of the four seasons, and is considered a major winter festival, and in ancient times it was said that "the winter solstice is as important as the New Year". Winter solstice customs vary in content or details depending on the region. In southern China, there is a custom of ancestor worship and feasting on the winter solstice. In northern China, it is customary to eat dumplings on the winter solstice.

			<p>Lesser Cold, the 23rd of the twenty-four solar terms, is the 5th of the winter season. It is the same as the cold, summer, summer and summer holidays, and it is a festival that indicates the change of temperature from cold to warm. It is characterized by cold, but it is not yet cold to the extreme. According to China's long-term meteorological records, in the northern regions, the small cold season is colder than the big cold season, in the north there is a “Lesser cold is better than the Greater Cold; but for some areas in the south, the lowest temperature of the year will still appear in the big cold season

			<p>Greater Cold, the last of the twenty-four solar terms, is the last of the twenty-four solar terms. Although the winter solstice is the lowest solar height in the northern hemisphere, the coldest time of the year is after the winter solstice, especially the coldest time of the year; this is because after the winter solstice, the direct sunlight point will gradually move north, but in the subsequent period of time, the direct sunlight point is still in the southern hemisphere, and the heat in the northern hemisphere is always in the state of dissipation, and the heat absorbed during the day is still less than the heat released at night. The heat absorbed during the day is still less than the heat released at night, so after the winter solstice, the temperature in the northern hemisphere continues to decrease, and the temperature drops to the lowest during the cold season.
