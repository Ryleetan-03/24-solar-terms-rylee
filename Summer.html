			<p>Lixia, the seventh of the twenty-four solar terms, is the first solar term of summer, and the time of its intersection is from May 05 to 07 of each year. One of the climatic characteristics of the summer festival is the significant increase in the process of thunderstorms and showers. The increase in precipitation and its intensity are due to the confrontation between cold and warm air and the convective weather generated by the rise of warm and humid air currents near the ground. The beginning of summer is an important festival that marks the beginning of the peak season for the growth of everything. According to modern Chinese climatology (average temperature), summer begins when the average daily temperature rises steadily above 22℃. Before the Lixia festival, the range of spring in China reaches its peak, except for Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi, south-central Jiangxi, southern Hunan and Fujian, where it is summer, and most of the rest of the country is still spring. At the beginning of summer, symbolizing the beginning of summer, the long-dormant summer begins to push northward in a big way, reaching northern China.

			<p>During Xiaoman, the southern part of China will generally have more rainfall and heavy rainfall; warm and humid air currents from the ocean are active and converge with the cold air entering south from the north, when there is often continuous and widespread heavy precipitation in southern China, causing heavy or very heavy rainfall; Jiangnan area is also often full of rivers and lakes, if the rain is low at this stage, it may be that the subtropical high pressure in the Pacific Ocean is weaker and positioned south, meaning that it is time to yellow plum time. In the north, little or no rainfall during the Xiaoman Festival, the temperature rises quickly during this period, and the temperature difference with the south is further reduced

			<p>Grain in Ear is of great importance in farming. It is also the cut-off point for planting crops, which is not valid after this time. The folk proverb "If you don't plant now, it is useless to plant them again" is about this. Grain in Ear is a busy season for farming, which is also known as "busy planting". This is the time when rice is planted in the south and wheat is harvested in the north.

			<p>The summer solstice is the tenth of the twenty-four solar terms. On the day of the summer solstice, the sun reaches its northernmost point in the year, almost directly over the Tropic of Cancer, when the daylight hours across the northern hemisphere reach the longest of the year. For the Tropic of Cancer and areas north of it, the summer solstice is also the day of the year with the highest noon solar height. High temperatures, high humidity, and occasional thunderstorms characterize the weather after the summer solstice

			<p>Lesser Heat is the eleventh of the twenty-four solar terms. It is the highest temperature, humid and muggy time of the year. Monsoon climate is the main feature of China's climate, and the summer is influenced by warm and humid air currents from the ocean, making many parts of China hot, humid and rainy. Although the sun is fierce, hot, humid and rainy during this time of the year, it is good for crops to grow during the same period of rain and heat.
